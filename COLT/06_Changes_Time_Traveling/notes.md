## Checking Out Old Commits

git checkout <commit id> / git checkout <first 7 characters of commit id>

If we use git git checkout the Head will be detached. In Normal Head points to a specific branch reference not a commit.
The Branch reference is a pointer to the last commit made on this particualr branch.

Now if using git checkout <commit id> the Head directly will point to that commit reference.
