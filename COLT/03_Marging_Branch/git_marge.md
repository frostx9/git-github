## Fast Forward Marging

When we create branch from main branch and we do some work on second branch. Then Some 
extra code will be added in second branch. Now if we want to merge this branch with main
branch then we will use fast forward marge. 

** Rember Fast Forward Marging will happened when no changes in Main Branch since work started
on Second Branch.
